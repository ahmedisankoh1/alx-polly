## ðŸš€ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.

## Security Audit & Remediation

This section documents the comprehensive security audit performed on ALX Polly and the remediation steps taken to address all identified vulnerabilities.

### ðŸ”´ Critical Vulnerabilities

#### Authentication & Authorization

**1. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - Poll Deletion**
- **Description**: The `deletePoll()` function lacked ownership verification, allowing any authenticated user to delete any poll by ID.
- **Impact**: Complete data loss, unauthorized poll deletion, service disruption.
- **Remediation**: Added server-side ownership verification before deletion:
  ```typescript
  // Verify ownership before deletion
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) return { error: "Unauthorized" };
  
  const { data: poll } = await supabase
    .from("polls")
    .select("user_id")
    .eq("id", id)
    .single();
    
  if (!poll || poll.user_id !== user.id) {
    return { error: "Unauthorized" };
  }
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify unauthorized users cannot delete other users' polls.

**2. Missing Row Level Security (RLS)**
- **Description**: No database-level access controls on Supabase tables, allowing any authenticated user to access any data.
- **Impact**: Complete user data exposure, unauthorized data modification, cross-user data access.
- **Remediation**: Implemented comprehensive RLS policies:
  ```sql
  -- Enable RLS on all tables
  ALTER TABLE polls ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  
  -- Users can only access their own polls
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view own polls" ON polls
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify cross-user data access is prevented.

**3. Client-Side Authorization Bypass**
- **Description**: UI-based authorization checks that could be bypassed through DOM manipulation or direct API calls.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized poll manipulation, UI-based privilege escalation.
- **Remediation**: Added error handling to show users when unauthorized actions are attempted:
  ```typescript
  const result = await deletePoll(poll.id);
  if (result?.error) {
    alert(result.error);
    return;
  }
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify direct API calls are properly authorized.

### ðŸŸ  High-Risk Vulnerabilities

#### Authentication & Authorization

**4. Missing Authentication on Vote Submission**
- **Description**: Anonymous voting was allowed, enabling ballot stuffing and vote manipulation.
- **Impact**: Vote integrity compromised, unlimited anonymous votes possible, inaccurate results.
- **Remediation**: Required authentication and prevented duplicate voting:
  ```typescript
  // Require authentication to vote
  if (!user) return { error: 'You must be logged in to vote.' };
  
  // Check for existing vote
  const { data: existingVote } = await supabase
    .from("votes")
    .select("id")
    .eq("poll_id", pollId)
    .eq("user_id", user.id)
    .single();
  ```
- **Tests**: Added tests to verify authentication required and duplicate voting prevented.

#### Input/Output Validation

**5. Insufficient Input Validation**
- **Description**: Minimal validation in poll creation, allowing XSS attacks and DoS through large payloads.
- **Impact**: Cross-site scripting, data corruption, application crashes.
- **Remediation**: Added comprehensive input validation:
  ```typescript
  // Input validation
  if (!question || question.trim().length === 0) {
    return { error: "Question is required." };
  }
  if (question.length > 200) {
    return { error: "Question must be less than 200 characters." };
  }
  if (options.length < 2) {
    return { error: "At least two options are required." };
  }
  if (options.length > 10) {
    return { error: "Maximum 10 options allowed." };
  }
  ```
- **Tests**: Added tests to verify XSS attempts and oversized inputs are rejected.

**6. Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
- **Description**: Database errors exposed to clients, revealing internal system information.
- **Impact**: Database schema exposure, system reconnaissance, attack surface mapping.
- **Remediation**: Replaced specific errors with generic messages and added server-side logging:
  ```typescript
  if (error) {
    console.error('Database error:', error);
    return { error: "Failed to create poll. Please try again." };
  }
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify no sensitive information is exposed to clients.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities

#### Security Controls

**7. Missing CSRF Protection**
- **Description**: No CSRF tokens in forms, allowing cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions using victim's session, cross-site request forgery.
- **Remediation**: Implemented CSRF token generation and validation:
  ```typescript
  // CSRF token validation
  const submittedToken = formData.get('csrf_token') as string;
  if (!submittedToken || !validateCSRFToken(submittedToken)) {
    setError('Invalid request. Please try again.');
    return;
  }
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify requests without valid CSRF tokens are rejected.

**8. Weak Session Management**
- **Description**: No secure cookie configuration, making sessions vulnerable to hijacking.
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, cross-site scripting.
- **Remediation**: Configured secure cookie settings:
  ```typescript
  const secureOptions = {
    ...options,
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'strict' as const,
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days
  };
  ```
- **Tests**: Added test to verify secure cookie flags are set.

### ðŸ”§ Additional Security Measures
